# ink2ngc
Inkscape extension to save .ngc file for milling machine.

GPL license.

This was hacked from a "unicorn" inkscape extension which made g-code for a 3d printer.

My version is initially just to make simple g-code from inkscape, for my engraving machine which is running bCNC and is only using the z height to activate the solenoid on the spindle.
